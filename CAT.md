  <h1>Linux CAT Command</h1>
</div>

- The cat command prints the content of a file.
- If we run,

```zsh

$   cat > Hello

```

And after this the command will be running to take input and then it will write it to a file with the name as `Hello`.

- The `>` operand is known as redirection operand that takes the output and gives it to the given file name.
