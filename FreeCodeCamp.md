## `ps`

- The ps command gives a list of processes running in the current session of OS.
- If we run `ps` command without any arguments it will print processes initiated by the current user.
- But if we run `ps ax`, gives all the processes.
- Use `ps axww` to list all commands on a new line (just a better formatting).


## `bg`

- `bg` command is used to make a running process or command become a background process.
- For this we first need to suspend the process with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> - <kbd>Z</kbd>.


## `fg`

- This does opposite of what `bg` does.
- It helps to make a background process to become foreground process.


## `type`

- This command gives information about the command that we pass to it.
- A command can be only of these types:
                        - a binary executable
                        - a shell built-in program
                        - a shell function
                        - an alias


## `which`

- This command gives the address of the binary executable file located in the system of the passed command.
